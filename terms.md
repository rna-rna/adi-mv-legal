The license to display the Art for the purchased NFT is automatically and always transferred with the NFT as provided below in Section 5\.

The restrictions in Section 4 will survive the expiration or termination of the licence granted in Section 3.
5.  **LIMITATIONS AND NO RIGHT TO TRADEMARKS**. Without limitation to Section 4 above, the licence in Section 3 does not include: (i) the right to use the Art to create additional NFTs; (ii) the right to create derivative works of the Art; (iii) the right to, and you may not, use any adidas trademarks in connection with the exercise of your licence in Section 3\.

If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased NFT for any reason, the license granted in Section 3 to you will immediately expire with respect to those NFTs without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for those NFTs. The license granted in Section 3 will also automatically terminate, with all rights returning to adidas if: (a) you breach any of the Terms which shall include, without limit, transferring, selling, donating or otherwise disposing of the Purchased NFT in a way not allowed specifically under the Terms; (b) you engage in any unlawful business practice related to the Purchased NFT or (c) if other circumstances occur which would make it unreasonable for the party to remain bound to the agreement until the next regular effective date of termination. In case you did not rightfully and lawfully purchase or acquire the NFT or upon any termination of the license granted in Section 3, adidas may disable your access to the Art and/or deny access to any further benefits, services or goods associated with the NFT and you shall delete, remove or otherwise destroy any backup or single digital copy of the Art.
